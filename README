Cash Card:Also called signature loans or personal loans. These loans are often used by borrowers for small purchases such as computers, home improvements, vacations or unexpected expenses.
An unsecured loan means the lender relies on your promise to pay it back. They're taking a bigger risk than with a secured loan, so interest rates for unsecured loans tend to be higher.
